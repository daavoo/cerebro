This mono-repo contains the python related areas of `fanequi単a`, that is an [A Industriosa](https://intranet.aindustriosa.org/) project about creating an autonomous boat.

Each folder in this mono-repo is a development area for `fanequi単a`, currently we are working on the following areas:

## Mastermind 
A Machine Learning model & engine created to make `fanequi単a` aware of it's surroundings while navigating.

## Commander
A [dronekit](http://python.dronekit.io/) project created to work together with `Cerebro` that would command `fanequi単a` using [pixhawk](https://pixhawk.org/).
